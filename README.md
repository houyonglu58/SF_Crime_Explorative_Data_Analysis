# SF-Crime-Rate-Analysis
In this notebook, I will use train classification models to explore spatical patterns and time-serires tendency of crime rates in San Francisco along the city's urbanization history. By builing machine learning data pipeline on Spark RDD, DataFrame and Spark SQL, I will perform OLAP to a dataset containing 2-million rows, each of which represents a crime incident. Supervised Machine Learning Models are trained, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors and Gradient Boosting etc, as well as ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average) model, to predict crime rates both region-wise and time-wise. Finally, analytical results with recommendation for optimal police force distribution and strategies are given to reduce crime rates.
