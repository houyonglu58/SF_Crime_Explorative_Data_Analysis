# SF Crime Dataset Explorative Data Analysis (EDA)

## 1. Introduction
This project aims to investigate on San Francisco crime data to discover patterns using summary statistics and graphical representations. With such initial exploration, I will be able to understand data distribution, spot anomalies, test initial hypothesis and check assumptions to make sense of data in hand. 

For my second project on the same SF Crime Dataset, I will ustilize the EDA results generated in this project, to perform a K-means clustering and train some machine learning models to predict crimes (e.g. time series analysis). Don't worry, I will upload my project in the coming future. 

## 2. Purpose of EDA
**Objectives**: Using statistics (or cross-tabulation) and graphics 
* To understand variables and find patterns that exist within it.
* To explore relationship between two or more variables 

I have creates a list of questions, answers to which can help me better understand crime data in both structural and contextual respects. I will put down my thoughts underneath my codes. Along with answering these questions, a cleared picture of SF Crimes from 2003 to 2018 will be presented. 

## 3. Findings & Solutions
Underneath each question, I put down findings, potential causes and actionable advice for SFPD in the "Remark" section. In the end there is a "Summary" compiling all findings, together with what I believe SFPD could do to better community safety.

Now, let's get started.
